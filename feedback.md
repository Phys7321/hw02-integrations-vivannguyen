I think the challenge problem looks good to me. you found the correct behavior. I would suggest some clean-ups to the charge distribution though. Look into contour plots and the numpy.quiver function. These will allow a much better display of the electric potential and fields. And also, you should try the same in MATLAB.

Very much improved. The contours and quiver plots do help to visualize vector fields better than other plots. I would like you (on your own, I don't necessarily need to see it) to think about how to graph the E-field and potential closer to the actual line charges. It is a good puzzle to figure out how to avoid being right on top of the charges.
